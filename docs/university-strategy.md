# University Data Strategy for Qogent.in

## Current Strategy (Interim Approach)

### Overview
As we build toward the full hub-and-spoke model with country-specific websites, we need an interim strategy for university data that provides value now while setting up for future expansion.

### University Selection Criteria

     - Available data and success stories
     - Popular among Indian students
   - Balance between public and private institutions

2. **Data Requirements Per University**:
   - Basic Information:
     - Name, location, founding year
     - Public/private status
     - International ranking (QS, THE, ARWU)

     - Student testimonials

### Implementation Approach

1. **URL Structure**:
   - `/universities` - Main directory listing all universities
   - `/universities/[country]/[university-slug]` - Individual university pages
   - Example: `/universities/germany/technical-university-munich`

2. **Page Components**:
   - Hero section with university image, logo, and key stats
   - Overview section with brief description and highlights
   - Programs tab/section with featured programs
   - Admissions requirements section with Qogent insights
   - Costs and funding breakdown
   - Student testimonials carousel/section
   - FAQ section for common questions
   - CTA section for consultation or more information

3. **Database Structure**:
   - Universities table with basic information
   - Programs table related to universities
   - Costs table with yearly updates
   - Requirements table for admission criteria
   - Testimonials table linked to universities

4. **Content Migration Readiness**:
   - Implement "Country: [Name]" tags on all university content
   - Store data in a structured format that can be easily exported
   - Use consistent naming conventions across university data

5. **Development Phases**:
   - Phase 1: Create university list page with filterable cards
   - Phase 2: Develop detailed university profile page template
   - Phase 3: Populate data for 5-8 universities per top country
   - Phase 4: Add program-specific information 
   - Phase 5: Integrate student testimonials and success stories

## Future Strategy (Hub-and-Spoke Model)

### Vision
Once country-specific websites (e.g., studyingermany.app, studyincanada.app) are developed, Qogent.in will transition to a true hub-and-spoke model for university data.

### Information Architecture

1. **Qogent.in (Hub)**:
   - Will feature condensed university cards with essential information
   - Focus on comparative data across countries
   - Include success metrics specific to Qogent
   - Serve as a discovery platform with filtering by field, cost, etc.

2. **Country-Specific Sites (Spokes)**:
   - Will host comprehensive university profiles
   - Include detailed program information
   - Feature country-specific application guides
   - Provide in-depth cost analysis and scholarship opportunities

### Technical Implementation

1. **Redirection Strategy**:
   - Implement seamless redirects from hub to spoke sites
   - Add prominent CTAs: "View Detailed Information on [StudyInCountry.app]"
   - Maintain shared session data where possible

2. **SEO Considerations**:
   - Use canonical tags to avoid duplicate content issues
   - Implement proper hreflang tags for country-specific variants
   - Structure site metadata to clarify the relationship between pages

3. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Establish a centralized database that feeds both hub and spoke sites
   - Implement versioning to track data updates
   - Create automated processes to sync critical information

4. **User Experience**:
   - Design a cohesive experience across hub and spoke sites
   - Maintain consistent branding while allowing for country-specific elements
   - Enable users to easily navigate between related universities across countries

### Migration Plan

1. **Pre-Migration Preparation**:
   - Audit all university content on Qogent.in
   - Prepare data exports for each country
   - Create mapping documentation for URL structures

2. **Phased Transition**:
   - Start with one country site as a pilot (e.g., Germany)
   - Implement redirection and monitor user behavior
   - Gather feedback and adjust approach before expanding to other countries

3. **Post-Migration Activities**:
   - Update internal links across all properties
   - Notify search engines of permanent redirects
   - Track performance metrics to ensure smooth transition
