# Qogent Website Design Strategy

## Design Vision

Qogent's website will be a vibrant, engaging digital space that resonates with students' aspirations for international education. The design will balance playful creativity with clear information architecture to create an experience that feels both exciting and trustworthy.

## Target Audience Psychology

Today's students (Gen Z and younger Millennials) expect:
- Visual storytelling over text-heavy content
- Authentic representation and diverse imagery
- Interactive elements that provide immediate feedback
- Mobile-first experiences with seamless transitions
- Personalization that acknowledges their unique journey
- Emotional connection through relatable design elements

## Color Strategy

### Primary Palette
- **Vibrant Gradient Base**: A dynamic gradient transitioning from deep indigo to vibrant teal as the primary brand identifier
- **Energetic Accent**: Bright coral/orange as the main accent color for CTAs and important elements
- **Complementary Highlights**: Strategic use of sunshine yellow and electric purple for visual interest

### Color Psychology Application
- **Indigo/Teal**: Represents wisdom, trust, and global perspective (core brand values)
- **Coral/Orange**: Symbolizes enthusiasm, creativity, and new beginnings (student journey)
- **Yellow**: Conveys optimism and clarity (decision-making support)
- **Purple**: Suggests imagination and transformation (life-changing opportunities)

### Dark Mode Implementation
- Dark mode as the default experience with rich, deep backgrounds
- Light mode option with carefully calibrated brightness levels
- Consistent color semantics across both modes

## Typography System

### Font Pairing Strategy
- **Primary Font**: Geist Sans - modern, clean, highly readable sans-serif for body text and UI
- **Display Font**: More expressive sans-serif with personality for headings and key statements
- **Accent Font**: Selective use of a handwritten-style font (like Caveat) for annotations, callouts, and personal touches

### Typographic Hierarchy
- Clear size progression from h1-h6 with appropriate spacing
- Strategic use of font weight, color, and style to create visual hierarchy
- Mobile-optimized line heights and letter spacing

## Visual Elements

- Vibrant, well-lit campus and city photography
- Documentary-style captures of student life moments
- Careful balance of aspirational vs. realistic representation

### Iconography
- Custom icon set with consistent stroke weight and rounded corners
- Animated micro-interactions for hover/active states
- Semantic color application for improved information processing

## UI Component Design
