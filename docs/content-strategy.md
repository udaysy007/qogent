## Writing Style Guidelines

### Conversational Writing Techniques

1. **Write Like Your Wittiest, Most Helpful Self**

   - Use contractions liberally (we're, you'll, don't, can't)
   - Ask direct questions as if you're in conversation ("Freaking out about visa interviews? Yeah, we did too.")
   - Use casual transitions and asides ("Look, we're not going to sugarcoat this...")
   - Include appropriate humor about universal student experiences
   - Incorporate parenthetical asides (like this one!) to create a sense of shared understanding

2. **Create Real Connection Through Vulnerability**

   - Share actual stories of mistakes, confusions, and triumphs
   - Use analogies that relate to everyday experiences ("Choosing a university is like picking a Netflix show when you're already tired – overwhelming until you narrow it down")
   - Acknowledge the emotional reality ("That moment when you get your first acceptance letter and suddenly can't remember how to breathe? Totally normal.")
   - Break the fourth wall occasionally ("We're going off on a tangent here, but this is important...")

3. **Simplify Everything Without Talking Down**

   - Break down complex concepts with unexpected comparisons ("Think of the Schengen visa like an all-access concert pass, but for countries")
   - Replace academic terms with everyday language ("not 'tertiary education systems' but 'how university actually works'")
   - Use examples that feel like stories ("Imagine you're sitting in your first German lecture and everyone suddenly starts knocking on their desks instead of clapping...")
   - Explain things like you would to a smart friend who's just unfamiliar with the topic

4. **Be Candidly Helpful**
   - Distinguish between official requirements and "how things actually work"
   - Share insider perspectives that challenge conventional advice
   - Admit when something is genuinely difficult or frustrating
   - Balance encouragement with honest reality checks

### Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**

- Write like you're messaging a friend who asked for help
- Create unexpectedly specific examples that make readers think "this person gets it!"
- Use gentle humor about universal challenges
- Include brief personal anecdotes or "we've been there" moments
- Break formatting rules occasionally for emphasis
- Use metaphors that create immediate understanding

**Don't:**

- Overuse emojis (stick to 1-2 per page maximum)
- Let casual tone undermine factual accuracy
- Use slang that might quickly become dated or isn't internationally understood
- Include humor about sensitive topics (visa rejections, financial hardships, etc.)
- Write lengthy, rambling paragraphs that lose focus
- Sacrifice clarity for cleverness

### Sample Voice Transformations

**Typical Education Website:**
"International students are required to submit documentation verifying financial capacity prior to visa issuance. Sufficient funds must be demonstrated to cover tuition and living expenses."

**New Qogent Voice:**
"Let's talk about proving you can actually afford to study abroad – aka the 'financial proof' part of your visa application. Every country wants to make sure you won't end up broke halfway through your degree (reasonable, honestly). We'll break down exactly what documents you need and how much money you should show. It's actually one of the more straightforward parts of the process, despite how intimidating it sounds!"

**Typical Education Website:**
"The university application procedure entails submission of academic transcripts, standardized test scores, and letters of recommendation."

**New Qogent Voice:**
"The university application process – or what we like to call 'the great document gathering adventure.' You'll need your academic transcripts (your grades, basically), those standardized test scores you stressed over, and a few people willing to write nice things about you (recommendation letters). Sounds simple when we put it that way, right? Don't worry – we'll walk you through the exactly what to submit, when to submit it, and how to make your application shine among thousands of others."

**Typical Education Website:**
"Housing options include university dormitories, private apartments, and homestays, each with varying cost implications and availability limitations."

**New Qogent Voice:**
"Finding a place to live: possibly the most stress-inducing part of studying abroad after visa applications. Your options typically include university dorms (convenient but not always available), private apartments (freedom comes with responsibility), or homestays (living with a local family – potentially awkward but often amazing for language learning). We've tried all three, and here's the unfiltered truth about each..."

## Typography & Visual Language

To complement our conversational tone, our visual language should feel equally approachable and student-friendly.

### Typography Strategy

1. **Primary Font: Modern & Clean**

   - Use Geist Sans for most body text and headings
   - Ensures readability and accessibility while feeling contemporary

2. **Accent Typography: Handwritten Elements**

   - Incorporate handwritten-style fonts for:
     - Callout quotes
     - Emphasis on key points
     - Section dividers
     - Annotations on images/diagrams
     - Student testimonial highlights
   - Recommended handwriting fonts:
     - "Caveat" for natural, casual notes
     - "Kalam" for clear, friendly annotations
     - "Indie Flower" for youthful, energetic highlights

3. **Typography Applications**
   - Use handwritten elements to "mark up" formal content, like a student would highlight a textbook
   - Create "sticky note" style callouts with handwritten fonts for tips and important points
   - Incorporate subtle handwritten elements in transitions between sections
   - Use for "personal touch" elements like signatures from student ambassadors

### Example Typography Combinations

- **Headers**: Geist Sans Bold
- **Body text**: Geist Sans Regular
- **Important callouts**: [Highlighted background] with Caveat font overlay
- **Student quotes**: Kalam font with student name in Geist Sans Italic
- **Navigation elements**: Geist Sans Medium
- **Interactive elements**: Combine Geist Sans with subtle Indie Flower accents

This typography strategy helps reinforce our friendly, student-centered approach while maintaining professionalism and readability across the site.
