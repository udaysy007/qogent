# University Images Guidelines

## Directory Structure
Each university should have its images organized in the following structure:
```
public/images/universities/<university-slug>/
└── main.jpg
```

## Image Specifications

### Main Image
1. `main.jpg`
   - Dimensions: 1600x900 pixels
   - Purpose: Used for all university images (hero banners, cards, thumbnails)
   - Content: High-quality landscape shot of the university
   - Next.js Image component handles responsive sizing and optimization

## Image Requirements

### Quality Guidelines
1. Resolution
   - High resolution (1600x900)
   - No pixelation or blur
   - Sharp and clear details

2. Content
   - Use actual images of the specific university
   - Avoid generic stock photos when possible
   - Images should be recent and representative

3. Technical Specifications
   - Format: JPEG (.jpg)
   - Color Space: sRGB
   - Quality: 80-85% (balance between quality and file size)
   - Maximum file size: 500KB

### Best Practices
1. Optimization
   - Compress images appropriately
   - Remove EXIF data
   - Use progressive JPEGs for better loading

2. Composition
   - Good lighting conditions
   - Clear subject matter
   - Professional looking
   - No heavy filters or effects

3. Seasonality
